gpsdecode
=========

This is a very simple set of programs for converting some GPS raw
binary data records to a CSV spreadsheet, and also performing the vice
versa conversion.  Originally I wrote it in circa 2010 for my dad so
he could do easier analysis of GPS data at work using Microsoft Excel.
I personally haven't used it since then.
